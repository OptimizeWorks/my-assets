# Latino Family Connections Static Site

This repository contains the exported static assets for the **Latino Family Connections** website. The files were generated using Webflow and can be viewed locally or hosted on any static web server.

## Viewing the Site

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser, **or** run a simple HTTP server and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```

## Future Knack Integration

The site currently has no database-backed features. We plan to connect it to a [Knack](https://www.knack.com/) application in order to manage dynamic content. Integration steps will include:

- Creating a Knack application with the required objects and fields.
- Using the Knack API to fetch and display data within the existing HTML.
- Adding JavaScript to authenticate and interact with Knack endpoints.

Placeholders or additional scripts will be added here as the integration is implemented.
